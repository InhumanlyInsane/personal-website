Hello there! This repo is for my project on creating my own personal website which can be seen in the following [LINK](https://vincentsuhardi.vercel.app/)

# Getting Started
This project uses the ReactJS and TailwindCSS frontend frameworks because this is only a static website. If you are interested on how this website was built, fork this repo and you may run the following:

## `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. \
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. \

The page will reload when you make changes. \
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
